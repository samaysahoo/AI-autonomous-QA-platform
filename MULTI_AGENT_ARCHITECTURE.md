- Priority-based message queuing
- Timeout and retry mechanisms
- Dead letter queue for failed messages

## Workflow Definitions

### 1. End-to-End Test Workflow
```
1. Plan Tests → 2. Execute Tests → 3. Analyze Results → 4. Learn from Results
```

**Steps**:
- Test planning based on code changes
- Adaptive test execution across platforms
- Failure clustering and root cause analysis
- Model updates based on results

### 2. Bug Triage Workflow
```
1. Analyze Bugs → 2. Suggest Fixes → 3. Plan Validation Tests
```

**Steps**:
- Automated bug analysis and clustering
- Fix suggestion generation with complexity assessment
- Validation test planning for bug fixes

### 3. Performance Optimization Workflow
```
1. Analyze Performance → 2. Optimize Models → 3. Update Strategies
```

**Steps**:
- Performance pattern analysis
- Model optimization based on metrics
- Strategy updates for improved efficiency

## Escalation System

### Escalation Levels
- **None**: No escalation needed
- **Low**: Log and attempt automatic resolution
- **Medium**: Notify team leads, attempt resolution with more resources
- **High**: Notify senior team, create incident ticket
- **Critical**: Immediate stakeholder notification, activate emergency procedures

### Escalation Triggers
- Agent failures or timeouts
- Workflow execution errors
- Critical system issues
- Performance degradation
- Security concerns
