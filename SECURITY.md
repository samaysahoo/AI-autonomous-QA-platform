# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: security@ai-test-automation-platform.com
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible:
- Affected components or modules
- Attack vectors
- Potential data exposure
- Proof of concept (if applicable)
- Suggested mitigation strategies

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Depends on complexity, typically 1-2 weeks

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
2. **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly
3. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Monitoring**: Enable security monitoring and alerting
6. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Use tools like `safety` and `bandit` for security scanning
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
4. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content
5. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens where applicable
6. **Secure Headers**: Use security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Configuration Security

1. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables or secret management systems
2. **Database Security**: Use encrypted connections and strong passwords
3. **API Security**: Implement rate limiting and authentication
4. **Container Security**: Use non-root users and minimal base images

## Security Tools

We use the following tools for security scanning:

- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

Run security checks locally:

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run security scans
make security-check
# or manually:
bandit -r src/
safety check
```

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys and Secrets

- OpenAI API keys are required for LLM functionality
- Jira API tokens for data ingestion
- Datadog/Sentry API keys for monitoring
- Database credentials for persistence

**Mitigation**: Use environment variables and never commit secrets to version control.

### External Dependencies

- ChromaDB and FAISS for vector storage
- OpenAI API calls for LLM functionality
- Kubernetes and Temporal for orchestration
- Redis for caching

**Mitigation**: Regular dependency updates and security scanning.

### Network Security

- FastAPI endpoints exposed by default
- Kubernetes ingress configurations
- Database connections

**Mitigation**: Use HTTPS, proper authentication, and network policies.

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Implement temporary mitigations
   - Notify affected users if necessary

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and evidence
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Resolution**:
   - Implement permanent fix
   - Update documentation
   - Communicate resolution

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct post-mortem
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch releases
- **High**: Next scheduled release
- **Medium/Low**: Following release cycle
